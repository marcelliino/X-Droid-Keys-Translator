# X-Droid-Keys-Translator
Experimental project using OpenFrameworks. This code produce a sound similar to Droids in StarWars when typing per key stroke, the main purpose is to speak like droid just by typing. In order to run this code you need OpenFrameworks.  No addons are needed, but I intended to use ofxGui addons
